# Automated Accessibility Testing

## What is Automated Accessibility Testing?

Automated accessibility testing is the use of software tools to test web content for accessibility issues. These tools can help identify issues that may be missed by manual testing. Automated testing can be used to test a large number of pages quickly and efficiently.

## Why Use Automated Accessibility Testing?

Automated accessibility testing can help identify accessibility issues early in the development process. This can help save time and resources by catching issues before they become more difficult to fix. Automated testing can also help ensure that accessibility issues are consistently identified and addressed across a website.

## Automated Accessibility Testing Tools

There are a number of tools available for automated accessibility testing. Some popular tools include:

## Why you need to test manually

Automated testing generally catches about 30% of issues, so manual testing is still necessary to catch the remaining 70% of issues.

Automated accessibility testing tools can be a valuable resource, but they are not a substitute for manual testing. Manual testing is still necessary to identify issues that automated tools may miss. Manual testing can also help ensure that the user experience is accessible and usable for people with disabilities.

Overall automated testing is a great way to catch a lot of issues quickly, but manual testing is still necessary to ensure that your website is truly accessible to all users.
