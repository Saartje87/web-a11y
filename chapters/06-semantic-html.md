# Semantic HTML

## What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup to reinforce the meaning of the information in webpages rather than merely define its appearance. Semantic HTML is the foundation of web accessibility and is essential for search engine optimization (SEO).

Using semantic HTML means knowing which element to choose for the right purpose.

## Why is Semantic HTML Important?

Semantic HTML is important for the following reasons:

- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML helps screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret the content correctly.
- **SEO**: Search engines use semantic HTML to understand the content and context of webpages, which can improve search engine rankings.
- **Maintainability**: Semantic HTML makes it easier to maintain and update webpages by providing a clear structure and meaning to the content.
- **Interoperability**: Semantic HTML ensures that webpages are compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms.

## Benefits of Using Semantic HTML

Some of the benefits of using semantic HTML include:

- Semantic HTML comes with built-in accessibility features.
- Native keyboard navigation is supported by semantic HTML elements.
- Using the right semantic element for the right purpose will give you a lot of accessibility features for free.

## Common Semantic HTML Elements

Here are some common semantic HTML elements and their usage:

- `<header>`: Represents introductory content at the beginning of a section or webpage.
- `<nav>`: Represents a section of navigation links.
- `<main>`: Represents the main content of a webpage.
- `<article>`: Represents a self-contained piece of content that can be independently distributed or reused.
- `<section>`: Represents a thematic grouping of content.
- `<aside>`: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it.
- `<footer>`: Represents a footer for a section or webpage.

## Best Practices for Using Semantic HTML

When using semantic HTML, consider the following best practices:

- Use semantic elements to define the structure and meaning of the content.
- Avoid using non-semantic elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<span>`) for structural purposes.
- Use headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to create a hierarchical structure for the content.
- Provide alternative text for images using the `alt` attribute in `<img>` elements.
- Use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`) to represent structured information.

By following these best practices, you can create webpages that are accessible, SEO-friendly, and easy to maintain.

## Conclusion

Semantic HTML is essential for creating accessible, but also SEO-friendly webpages. By using the right semantic elements for the right purpose, you can improve the structure and meaning of your content, making it easier for users and search engines to understand.

Test, test, test! Use screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies to test the accessibility of your webpages. Validate your HTML code using the W3C HTML Validator to ensure that it is semantically correct and free of errors.

"Your semantic HTML is only as accessible as you make it, and maintain it" - Accessible engineer Scott O'Hara

Semantics are only the first step towarrds creating accessible content. You must also consider the use of ARIA roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of your webpages.
