# Web Accessibility

## What is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web. More specifically, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that they can contribute to the Web. Web accessibility also benefits others, including older people with changing abilities due to aging.

## Why is Web Accessibility Important?

The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities. An accessible Web can also help people with disabilities more actively participate in society.

## How to Make the Web Accessible?

- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses).
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform).
- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable. This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding).
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible).

## Web Accessibility Guidelines

- **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**: Provides a shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally.

## Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools

- **WAVE**: Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
- **Lighthouse**: An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages.
- **axe**: Accessibility engine for automated testing of HTML-based user interfaces.
